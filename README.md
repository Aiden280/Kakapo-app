Kakapo app is an ambient sound mixer for relaxation or productivity that works on Mac & Windows.

[Download the latest version here](https://github.com/bluedaniel/Kakapo-app/releases).

A lot of the code is based on the Kakapo website ([Link](http://kakapo.co)) ([GitHub](https://github.com/bluedaniel/Kakapo-web/)) but the main differences are:

- Easily add sounds from the web or from your computer.
- Downloads YouTube and SoundCloud files to play offline.
- Auto-updates to the newest version.

## Contribute
You are most welcome to do with this repo what you will :smile:.

It would be cool to have the app translated into other languages (json files in `app/i18n`) but any types of contribution, be it ideas, bug fixes, fixing typos, will be appreciated !
